# Portfolio-CS-305

The client, Artemis Financial, wanted to create a software that would be able to provide finance plans to their customers. This would be checking, savings, and retirement accounts to state a few. The client wanted their website to be able to have secure communications, certificates on the site to prove the legitimacy of the business, and then implement a hashing algorithm to protect not only user data, but also the public key the client wanted their customers to have access to. I believe that I good when it came to implementing the hashing algorithm as well as the certifiacte for the website. When it came to making the website secure, however, that was one area that I found myself struggling with the most. Running the dependency checks and suppressing the vulnerabilities wasn't too difficult of a task, just a lengthy one in reality.

When it comes to the recourses that I used for this assignment, I ended up looking up a lot of online sites that go into further explaination of programming topics (W3 Schools, GeeksforGeeks, etx) as well as community forums that would help with the type of problem, not the assignment itself. I believe that I could show future employers that I have the ability to generate self-signed certificates and have the ability to implement a hashing algorithm to protect data. I would just need to work on the ability to make the website secure.
